**Example**: Press `3` then `n` to skip forward 3 tracks, or `2` then `b` to go back 2 tracks.

## Command Line Interface

While not keyboard shortcuts per se, these are commonly used text commands within the Aurras interface:

- **Search and Play**: Simply type a song name to search and play
- **Lyrics toggle**: Type `lyrics` to toggle on or off
- **Playlist Operations**: Use `view <name>` or `v <name>` to view playlists, `playlist <name>` or `p <name>` to play them
- **Download Options**: Use `d "song 1, song 2"` or `download "song 1, song 2"` or even download playlists `dp <name>` or `downploadp <name>`

## Tips for Efficient Usage

1. **Quick Volume Control**: Use `UP`/`DOWN` arrow keys for volume adjustment during playback

2. **Seeking**: Use `LEFT`/`RIGHT` arrow keys to seek through the current track

3. **Jump Mode**: Use number keys followed by `n` or `b` for quick multi-track navigation

4. **Command Palette**: Press `>` to quickly access all available commands

5. **Lyrics Toggle**: Press `l` to show/hide lyrics when available

6. **Theme Switching**: Press `t` to cycle through available themes

7. **Emergency Exit**: Use `Ctrl+C` to forcefully exit if needed

> **Note**: These shortcuts are active during music playback. When in command input mode, normal text input takes precedence over these shortcuts.
