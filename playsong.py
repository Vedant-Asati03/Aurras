"""
A module for playing and listening to songs online and offline.

This module provides classes for playing songs using an MPV player, listening to songs online,
and listening to playlists both online and offline.

Classes:
    - MPVPlayer: A class representing an MPV player for playing media files.
    - SongPlayer: A base class for playing songs online and offline.
    - ListenSongOnline: A class for listening to a song online.
    - ListenSongOffline: A class for listening to a song offline.
    - ListenPlaylistOnline: A class for listening to a playlist online.
    - ListenPlaylistOffline: A class for listening to a playlist offline.

Attributes:
    - path: A module-level configuration for file paths.

Note:
    - This module uses external modules such as rich, pytube, and sqlite3 for various functionalities.

Usage:
    - To use the classes in this module, import them into your script and create instances as needed.
